\chapter{Motivation}
As smartphones continue to be ubiquitous, the popularity of mobile Machine Learning (ML) 
is on the rise due to the increasing power of devices. Mobile applications encompass 
a wide range of intelligent features, including visual filters and voice assistants. 
Nevertheless, the computation requirements of Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference 
pose a challenge, as devices often struggle to balance responsiveness with the demands
of running complex intelligence tasks.
